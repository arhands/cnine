Lightweight C++ tensor library

Cnine is a simple C++/CUDA tensor library developed by Risi Kondor's group at the University of Chicago.
Cnine is designed to make some of the power of modern GPU architectures accessible directly from C++ code, without relying on complex proprietary libraries. 

Documentation for the Python/PyTorch API is at https://risi-kondor.github.io/cnine/.
